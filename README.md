# CSharp_BikersDatabaseApp

This project was created in Visual Studio (ASP.NET MVC) using the the Scaffolding method to render a web form that is able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data from a SQL database. The project is built in C# having a SeedData file to populate the database at first and had the database connection made with Entity Framework Core Migrations.


The web form opens in the 'home' page and the user can click the link to go to the Bikers database list. One of the columns is a link to a youtube video of the Biker:
